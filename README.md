# Smart-Irrigation-Energy-Prediction
A sustainable agriculture project using Machine Learning to predict irrigation energy consumption and optimize water and power usage for eco-friendly farming.
This project applies Machine Learning to promote sustainable farming by predicting the energy consumption of irrigation systems. It enables farmers to plan irrigation efficiently, minimizing both electricity usage and water waste.

Sustainability Impact

Reduces unnecessary power usage in agriculture.
Prevents over-irrigation and conserves water.
Decreases carbon footprint from excessive electricity.
Supports SDG 7 (Affordable & Clean Energy), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption), and SDG 13 (Climate Action).
Machine Learning Approach:
Models tested:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Evaluation metrics:

R² Score
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
Results

Random Forest achieved highest accuracy.
Feature importance showed Temperature and Soil Moisture as key contributors
Features

Predict daily energy needs.
Alert farmers on overuse or inefficiency.
Seasonal analysis for irrigation planning.
Dashboard with insights for smart, green agriculture.
Future Enhancements

Integrate real-time IoT sensors for continuous data.
Develop a mobile app for farmers to monitor usage.
Add renewable energy prediction (solar-based irrigation).
